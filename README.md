# INTRODUCTION
The Victorian era, in British history, is the period corresponding roughly but not exactly to the period of Queen Victoria's reign (1837–1901) and had fashion impact around the world.


The intention behind this project is to reach out the majority of enthusiastic and admires of the Victorian Era and build a community, exchange experiences and be able to participate in events related to that.


# ABOUT
This project is an extension of my love and the hobby I cultivated throw the years of my life and that increased during the pandemic time when we all had to be recluse, and I had the privilege to be able to use my time to learn how to sue, create and make clothes and some stays-corset from the Victorian Age Epoch.

# TESTING


# KNOWN ISSUES
In my first experience using Github, I initially misunderstood the process. I thought that even minor changes, such as fixing a typo or coding a single line, required committing and pushing to see the effects on my local copy of the website. So I thought I was doind something wrong and I deleted the entire project and started over.
This is my first ever website project and I struggled with terms of coding and the design aspects mirrowing from html to css files. I have learnt a lot from this however there are still present issues on the website and I do hope to have the time and focus on solving.

# DEPLOYMENTS
I published the Github page with my website by going to my repository settings and under the code and automations thus deploying the website to be live.

# MEDIA
All images on the Gallery page were taken by me, Bianca Betinelli and my dear friend Caroline Daleffe and therefore it is our work that are displayed.

# CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I would like to extend some thanks, not only to the online resources, but also to my husband and best friend, Herick Zerunian that helped me during this project being my first fan, motivational and emotional suport. Also to my friend Caroline for the great energy and friendship throw the years.To my friend Tania that has taking her personal time to teach me suing  stays corsets, clothes and so much more about the Victorian Era that we both hold dear. To my mentor Rory Patric who aided me when everything was a bit caotic and some of my new "Slack" friends, that aided ne when I needed the most.
