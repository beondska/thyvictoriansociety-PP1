<h1>Thy Victorian Society</h1>

<h2>A space for lovers of a bygone era!</h2>

This project is an extention of my love and the hobbie I cultivated throw the years of my life and  that incrised during the pandemic time when we all had to be recluded and I had the privilege to be able to use my time to learn how to sue, create and make clothes and some stays-corset from the Victorian Age Epoch (1820's to 1901's).

The Victorian era, in British history, is the period corresponding roughly but not exactly to the period of Queen Victoria's reign (1837–1901) and had fashion impact around the world.

The intention behind this project is to reach out the majority of enthusiastics and admires od the Victorian Era and build a comminity, exchange experiences and be able to participate on events related to that.
